          p
            | A recent report, by Royal London, has found that over 5.4 million UK adults do not have a Will and would not know where to start if they were to write one; The research indicated that 31% of those respondents who had made a Will in the past, had also
            | lived through a significant life event like marriage (which invalidates a Will) or having a child. However, 53% had failed to update their Will following these monumental and life changing events.
          p
            | Wills and estate planning can enable you to protect assets, shield loved ones from financial or practical difficulties and disputes, save tax and benefit valued individuals and causes ensuring your wishes are honoured. However, Wills and Estate Planning
            | isn't just about passing on money and assets but also about making the most of life right now ensuring you have enough to live on to meet your goals.
          p
            | Through instructing a professional, a relatively small time and financial investment today can reap manifold benefits tomorrow for those left behind and potentially for generations to come.

            | Sadly there are situations where people become unable to make decisions about their own affairs. not only due to old age and dementia but also as a result of accident, illness or some other mental incapacity. This can happen at any age. In some instances
            | people can make some decisions but need help with others. A lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) is needed in these situations.
          p
            | There are two types of LPA, Property and Financial Affairs and a Health and Welfare. Both allow someone (your attorney) to manage your affairs should you no longer be able to.
          p
            | A little forward planning in setting up an LPA can avoid costly and time consuming court proceedings resulting in considerable stress and expense. Even essential, everyday transactions such as the use of a joint bank account can become impossible without
            | an appropriate LPA should incapcity occur. Contact us about the two types of LPAs and how they can help protect you and your loved ones.

          p
            | A lay person acting as an executor can find themselves dealing with a specialised and sometimes highly complex undertaking at an otherwise challenging time. This is when many will engage the services of a professional administrator to assist with the

          p
            | This then helps to avoid getting out of their depth and it's associated consequences and also alleviates the responsibility for getting things right for the beneficiaries some of whom might question the executor's activities. In the long term choosing
