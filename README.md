## How to compile

I designed this before I understood more standard build scripts, so you will have to contend with my less standard build process. 

### Install

- [image-watcher](https://gitlab.com/efunb/image-watcher)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
- [html-minifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier)

### Run

One of the compile scripts `.sh` for linux and `.bat` for windows.
